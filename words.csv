Non- is used with nouns, adjectives and adverbs and indicates an absence of something:  a nondrinker    a non-stick pan    speaking nonstop. Un- is added to adjectives and indicates the opposite quality from the simple word: unexpected  =  ‘surprising’    unwise  =  ‘foolish’.  Compare non-British (‘of a nationality which is not British’) and un-British (‘being disloyal to Britain’).  2 In- is used with fewer words than un-, also to form opposites.  There are variant spellings: il- before l (illogical); im- before b, m, p (imbalance, immaterial, impossible) and ir- before r (irresponsible).  3 Dis- is also used with verbs, adjectives and nouns to form opposites: dislike    disobedient    distrust.  4 A- is mostly used in formal or technical words to indicate ‘lacking in’ or ‘lack of’: amorphous (‘lackingin shape’)    anarchy (‘lack of rule’).  5 It is not possible to predict whether un-, in- or dis- is used with a particular word and the correct form must be noted and learned",NA,NA,NA52359,UN ,abbr United Nations: the UN Secretary General. ,NA,NA,NA52368,UNABASHED ,adj (fml or joc) ningzak lo; ningzahnak tikcu a thlen tik khalih ningzak lomi: Tim appeared unabashed by all the media attention. ,NA,NA,NA52375,UNABATED ,"adj [usu pred] (of a storm, an argument, a crisis, etc) a kel a simi; demdeuh cuang lo, keel-awh:  The gales continued unabated.    Our enthusiasm remained unabated.
